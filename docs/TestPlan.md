# Test Plan Document
**About Conduit - A RealWorld Example App**

## 1. Introduction
This Test Plan has been created to communicate the testing approach to all project members. It includes the objectives, scope, risks, and approaches. This document will clearly identify the test deliverables, testing tools, testing methods, and what is deemed in and out of scope. It will be updated as the project evolves to ensure client satisfaction by delivering a product of quality.

### About Conduit
This description is based on the RealWorld GitHub project: https://github.com/thanhdev/realworld-django-rest-framework-angular?tab=readme-ov-file.

Conduit is a Medium.com clone developed as part of the RealWorld Example Apps initiative. The chosen implementation uses Django REST Framework (backend) and Angular (frontend). It demonstrates real-world features such as authentication, CRUD operations, comments, favorites, and user profiles.

This project was selected because it provides production-like functionality and follows the standard RealWorld API specification, making it highly suitable for manual and automated testing. Its coverage of frontend and backend workflows allows QA engineers to validate end-to-end scenarios, API integrity, and UI automation in a realistic application environment.

## 2. Quality Objectives

### a. Primary Objective
Ensure the system meets the key functional requirements for Articles and Comments, including auth, CRUD, favorites, and basic permissions, so users can complete core flows without issues.

### b. Secondary Objectives
- Perform manual testing of features promoted to Ready to Test across environments.
- Collaborate with developers in defect investigation and resolution.
- Create and maintain baseline test cases for manual and automation.
- Identify, track, and communicate risks before release.

## 3. QA Team
Andr√©s Cruz - QA Engineer - andres.cruz@example.com.

## 4. Ramp-Up Tasks
- Review the tech stack and the main user flows.
- Set up automation tools: Playwright for UI and Postman for API.
- Seed test accounts and initial content for reproducible runs.

## 5. Target Devices and Browsers
- Windows with latest Chrome.
- macOS with latest Chrome and Safari.

## 6. Testing Environments
- Staging for main validation and regression before releases.
- Production for smoke test or sanity post-deploy.
- Local setup for development and QA using test data when needed.

## 7. Test Techniques
- **Smoke Testing:** A brief check that the build is stable enough to continue testing.
- **Functional Testing:** Confirms each feature behaves as the requirements describe, for valid and invalid inputs.
- **Integration Testing:** Confirms different parts of the system work together and exchange information correctly.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Time-boxed sessions where the tester investigates and designs tests on the fly to uncover issues.
- **Sanity Testing:** A short check after a small change to verify the fix and nearby behavior.
- **API Testing:** Checks that requests and responses are correct and that error messages are clear and consistent.
- **Performance Testing:** Checks that responses are quick and consistent under normal use.

## 8. Bug Management
Defects will be tracked in GitHub Issues, Jira, or Azure DevOps. Each bug must include:
- Title and description.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected and actual results.
- Evidence logs or screenshots.
- Severity and priority.

## 9. Test Deliverables
- Test cases provided in a CSV file containing: id, title, Gherkin scenario, steps, expected result, priority, type.
- Regression notes and reports after full runs.
- API Postman collection linked to the repo.
- Automated tests repo: Playwright TypeScript that covers critical flows.

## 10. Test Tools
- Playwright TypeScript for UI and E2E.
- Postman for API.
- GitHub Issues, Jira, or Azure DevOps for tracking.

## 11. Automation Strategy with Playwright + TypeScript
- Plan P1 flows: articles, comments, login, sign-up.
- Build a small smoke set to run fast and give quick feedback.
- Expand coverage to P1 flows with positive and negative paths and simple permissions checks.
- Use test users and small data sets to keep runs repeatable.
- Report results with HTML reports.
- Maintain and update the suite when flows or UI change.

## 12. Risks and Contingencies
- **Risk:** Old data shown on screen after actions.
  **Possibility:** Medium.
  **Impact:** Medium; users may see incorrect info and take wrong actions.
  **Solution:** Refresh the view after each action, re-read data from the source, and add a quick check that the screen shows the updated information.

- **Risk:** Environment downtime.
  **Possibility:** Low.
  **Impact:** High; testing and releases are blocked.
  **Solution:** Notify DevOps immediately, switch to tasks that do not depend on the environment, and reschedule tests once service is restored.

- **Risk:** Third-party or API outage.
  **Possibility:** Medium.
  **Impact:** High; key flows cannot be completed.
  **Solution:** Log details and inform the team, retry when the service is back, and, if possible, use a temporary fallback or mock data to continue limited checks.
