# Playwright + Typescript Automation for Conduit RealWorld Example Apps

## About Conduit
This description is based on the RealWorld GitHub project: https://github.com/thanhdev/realworld-django-rest-framework-angular?tab=readme-ov-file.

Conduit is a Medium.com clone developed as part of the RealWorld Example Apps initiative. The chosen implementation uses Django REST Framework (backend) and Angular (frontend). It demonstrates real-world features such as authentication, CRUD operations, comments, favorites, and user profiles.

This project was selected because it provides production-like functionality and follows the standard RealWorld API specification, making it highly suitable for manual and automated testing. Its coverage of frontend and backend workflows allows QA engineers to validate end-to-end scenarios, API integrity, and UI automation in a realistic application environment.
